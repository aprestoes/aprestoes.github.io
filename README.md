# Dan(g)

A simplistic, minimalistic, barebones (and all the other good ajectives) one-page portfoilo website.

As of right now it's a glorified landing page, but it serves as a nice showcase for Owl Carousel and the default Skeleton template.

## Config
```
const sentenceBeginning = "Hi, I'm ";
const words = [
  "Dan."
];
```
